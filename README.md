# IGLDA - Integration of Global and Local Metrics for Domain Adaptation Learning 

This is the matlab source code of "Integration of Global and Local Metrics for Domain Adaptation Learning Via Dimensionality Reduction", 
and I also upolad the datasets used in our experiments.

If you want to use the code for your research, please cite the following paper. Thanks a lot!
